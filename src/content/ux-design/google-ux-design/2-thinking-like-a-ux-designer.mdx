## Three Big Design Approaches

1. üß¢ **Universal Design**

   - **One-size-fits-all approach**
   - Tries to design **one product** for **everyone**, in **every situation**
   - Sounds nice in theory‚Ä¶ but rarely works well in practice
   - Like a ‚Äúone-size‚Äù hat that still **doesn't fit most people**
   - **Problem**: When you try to include everyone with one solution, you often end up **excluding many**
   - **Lesson**: Good intentions don't always lead to good outcomes.

2. üåç **Inclusive Design**

   - **Solve for one, extend to many**
   - Designs are tailored to meet **different needs**‚Äînot just ‚Äúthe average‚Äù user
   - Considers **identifiers** like:
     - Ability
     - Race
     - Age
     - Gender
     - Language
     - Economic background
   - **Key practice**: Include underrepresented voices **in the design process**, not just as testers at the end
   - Listen ‚Üí Understand ‚Üí Design better
   - **Example**: Design for blind or deaf users first ‚Üí improvements ripple out to others
   - ‚ÄúIn inclusive design, there's **no such thing as normal**.‚Äù

- ‚ôøÔ∏è **Accessibility = Part of Inclusive Design**
  - Designing for:
  - People with **disabilities** (physical, cognitive, sensory, etc.)
  - Often starts with **blind**, **deaf**, and **mobility-impaired** users
  - But benefits everyone through better usability, clarity, and flexibility
  - **Pro tip**: Accessibility isn't a ‚Äúnice to have.‚Äù It's a **must** in great UX.

3. ‚öñÔ∏è **Equity-Focused Design**

   - **Design to uplift historically excluded groups**
   - Builds **on inclusive design**, but goes further
   - Focuses not just on present exclusions, but on **past systemic exclusion**
   - Aims for **fair outcomes**, not just equal inputs
   - **Equality** = everyone gets the same thing
   - **Equity** = everyone gets what they need to succeed ‚Üí Think: different-sized boxes so **everyone sees over the fence**
   - **Real-World Design Flow**:
     - Identify your product
     - Ask: Who has been historically excluded from this type of product?
     - Build with **their needs front and center**

## User vs End User

- **User**: Any person who uses a product
- **End User**: The specific audience a UX designer creates something for
- Our goal as a UX designer is to think about problems and needs from the end users perspective
- Example: Animated movie, end users are kids with age five to seven, users are adults and teenagers

## Who Are Users in UX Design?

- **Users** = **Problem-solvers** looking for a **product or service** to help them.
- UX is about the **journey** users take with your design.
- Your job as a UX designer? **Put the user first** in every decision.
- Most of the initial UX research focuses on:
  - User characteristics
  - Goals
  - Pain points
- Avoid **assumptions** or **stereotypes** ‚Äî users may differ on the surface but share deeper needs.
- Consider **overlooked users** intentionally!
- [What is user research, and what's its purpose?](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-importance-of-user-research-and-how-to-do-it/)

**Key User Research Questions**

- Ask yourself:
  - Do users have **impairments or disabilities** (temporary, situational, or permanent)?
  - How **tech-savvy** are they?
  - **How/where/when** are they accessing your product?
  - Are you considering **ALL potential users**?

‚ôøÔ∏è **Accessibility Matters**

- **Accessibility**: The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities
- a11y = accessibility, 11 in the a11y is the letters in between a and y
- Over** 1 billion** people globally have disabilities.
- In the U.S., **1 in 4 adults** reports a disability.
- **Accessibility = designing for all**, not just people with disabilities.
- Features like **closed captions** or **enlarged fonts** help everyone!
- [Designing for Global Accessibility, Part I: Awareness is everything](https://design.google/library/designing-global-accessibility-part-1/) from Google

üåê **Digital Literacy & New Users**

- Nearly **1 billion people** are getting **online for the first time**.
- Not everyone knows what a **swipe** is‚Äîor even what a **touchscreen** does.
- Design for those with **limited digital literacy** to boost confidence and usability.

üì± **Access Differences**

- Devices and internet access vary due to **cost** and **infrastructure**.
- Some users may:
  - Have **limited data**
  - Experience **spotty coverage**
- **Offline UX** should be considered to support these users.

üåç **Global Context & Culture**

- Users might come from **different countries**, **languages**, and **cultures**.
- Consider:
  - **Multilingual features**
  - **Localized icons** (like currency signs)
  - **Cultural norms** and **shifting trends**

**Key Takeaway**

- Great UX means making every user feel like your design was **made just for them**, no matter their background, ability, or tech familiarity.

## Assistive Technology (AT)

- Assistive technology is technology used by individuals with disabilities in order to perform functions that might otherwise be difficult or impossible.
- Kinds of assistive technologies:
  - Color modification (ex, high contrast)
  - Voice control (using only their voice)
  - Screen readers (people with limited vision)
  - Alternative text (translates a visual user interface into a text-based user interface)
