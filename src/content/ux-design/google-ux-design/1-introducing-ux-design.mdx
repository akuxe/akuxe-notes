## What is User Experience?

- **User experience** is how a person feels when interacting with a product.
- A **product** can be:
  - A physical item (e.g., game controller, ketchup bottle)
  - A digital tool (e.g., app, website, smartwatch)

## What Makes a Good User Experience?

**The 4 Pillars of Good Design**: Core UX Qualities

Good design might look simple, but it's backed by smart choices. These four qualities help you evaluate if a product is delivering a great user experience:

1. **Usable**: Easy to Use

   - **Definition**: A product is **usable** when it's clear, intuitive, and helps users accomplish tasks with ease.
   - **Ask yourself**:
     - Is everything easy to **find**?
     - Is the functionality **clear**?
     - Can users complete **specific tasks** easily?
   - **Example**: In an airline app, being able to quickly enter travel details on the homepage shows good usability.

2. **Equitable**: Inclusive & Fair

   - **Definition**: A product is **equitable** when it works well for people with **diverse abilities and backgrounds**, including underrepresented users.
   - **Ask yourself**:
     - Are the needs of **diverse users** being considered?
     - Does it support **underrepresented** groups?
     - **Example**: In a messaging app, including emoji skin tones and gender-neutral avatars increases equity.

3. **Enjoyable**: Brings Delight
   - **Definition**: A product is **enjoyable** when it creates a **positive emotional connection** with the user.
   - **Ask yourself:**
     - Does it consider the **user's feelings**?
     - Does it **delight** or engage the user?
   - **Example**: A streaming app offering customized recommendations and profile appearance options makes it more enjoyable.
4. **Useful**: Solves Real Problems
   - **Definition**: A product is **useful** if it actually helps users **achieve their goals** and solve problems.
   - **Ask yourself**:
     - Does it **solve a problem**?
     - Does it help users **reach a goal**?
     - Does it **add value**?
   - **Example**: A banking app that allows bill payments and money transfers is useful to users managing finances.

💡 **TL;DR**

- Good UX = **Usable** + **Equitable** + **Enjoyable** + **Useful**
- Each plays a different role, but together they create a product that people love and return to.

**Role of Research**

- UX relies on **research** to understand users’ needs, feelings, and behaviors.
- Designers gather real-time feedback to improve products.

## Why UX Design Matters for Business

- A 2018 McKinsey study showed:
  - Companies that prioritize design outperform competitors.
- Great UX leads to:
  - More user engagement
  - Word-of-mouth promotion
  - Positive brand perception

## Product Development Lifecycle Overview

- Every product goes through **5 key stages**:

  1. **Brainstorm** 🧠
  2. **Define** 🎯
  3. **Design** 🎨
  4. **Test** 🧪
  5. **Launch** 🚀

- It's a cyclical process, teams might **repeat** or **spend longer** on certain stages.
- UX designers are most active in the **design Stage**, but collaborate throughout with researchers, PMs, and engineers

🧠 **Stage 1: Brainstorm**

- Team identifies **user problems** and begins ideating solutions
- **Diverse teams** bring better ideas through varied life experiences
- User feedback, surveys, and **competitive research** help guide direction
- UX designers at **startups** may be heavily involved here, while those at large companies may be less so

🎯 **Stage 2: Define**

- Clarifies **who** the product is for, **what** it does, and **what features** it needs
- Focus is narrowed to solve **one main problem** — not everything at once
- Uses insights from brainstorm & research to determine **core user needs**
- Product leads usually define **scope**, UX designers help **refine the vision**

🎨 **Stage 3: Design**

- UX designers create **wireframes** (structure) and **prototypes** (interactivity)
- UX writers contribute microcopy (e.g., button text, labels)
- Design must align with earlier defined specs and offer a **smooth, intuitive flow**
- Ensures each interaction is clear, functional, and user-friendly

🧪 **Stage 4: Test**

- Product is tested **internally (alpha), with stakeholders**, and **externally (beta)** 🧬
- 🏠 **Alpha**: Internal QA and usability checks
- 🧑‍💼 **Stakeholders**: Brand alignment, legal/accessibility compliance
- 👥 **Beta**: Real users test usability, enjoyability, usefulness, and equity
- Feedback is used to iterate, often returning to design → test again 🔄
- Tools like **Figma** help with early prototype testing

🚀 **Stage 5: Launch**

- Final product goes live in app stores, on websites, or physical shelves
- **Marketing**, **customer support**, and **PMs** coordinate promotion and support
- Teams reflect: ✅ What worked? ❌ What didn't?
- For **digital products**, launch is often just the beginning → feedback leads to new versions 🔁

**Beyond the Lifecycle**

- Everything around you — digital or physical — has gone through this process!
- Spotting thoughtful design helps you **think like a UX designer** in everyday life 👀✨

**UX Designers work with:**

- **UX Researcher** 📊: Conduct studies or interviews that help us learn how users use a product
- **UX Writer** 📝: Think about how to make the language within a product clearer
- **Production Designers** 🎨: Make sure first and final designs match in the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering team (Assets: Everything from text and images to design specifications, like font style, color, size, and spacing)
- **UX Engineers** 🚀: Translate the design's intent into a functioning experience 💻
- **UX Program Managers** 📅: Ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish
