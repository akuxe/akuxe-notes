## UX Research in the Design Process

**Why UX Research Matters**

- **User-first mindset** is the golden rule of UX design.
- Research helps uncover **user behaviors, needs**, and **motivations**.
- Essential for making **informed, user-centered decisions** early in the design.

**Design Thinking + UX Research**

- Research plays a key role in the **Empathize** and **Define** phases of the design thinking framework.

🤝 **Empathize Phase**

- **Goal: Understand the user's world.**
- **Methods**: **Interviews** to explore user pain points and transportation needs.
- **Outcome**: Designers build **empathy** and identify **user expectations & challenges.**

📝 **Define Phase**

- **Goal: Narrow down the design challenge.**
- **Methods**: Use **surveys, focus groups** to collect user feedback.
- **Outcome**:
  - Prioritize **key features and functionality.**
  - Create **clear, user-driven design goals.**
  - **Example goal**: “Design an app with **multiple transport options, transparent pricing**, and **easy payment**.”

🔄 **Research Throughout the Process**

- Continues in every phase, not just early on.
- Includes:
  - **User feedback**
  - **Usability testing**
  - **Validating design decisions**

## Intro to UX Research

- **UX Research 🔍 = User First, Always.**
- **understanding users** through observation + feedback
- **Two key parts** of every UX design project:
  - 📝 **Learn about users** (research)
  - 💬 **Get their feedback** (validation)
- Build on **facts, not assumptions.**
- Research aligns **what designers think** users need with **what users actually need.**
- 🎯 **Goal**: **Prioritize user needs**, while also considering **business goals** 💼

🏢 **UX Roles Vary by Company**

- **Big companies** (e.g., Google) → Designers often have a dedicated UX research partner 🔍
- **Small companies/startups** → Designers wear multiple hats (design + research) 🎨🔍
- Knowing both = **super valuable & hireable** 🚀💼

🧑‍💻 **Key Traits of a Great UX Researcher**

- **Empathy** 🧡 - understand users emotions & perspectives
- **Pragmatism** ⚙️ - practical, goal-focused problem-solving
- **Collaboration** 🤝 - work well across diverse teams

## UX Research Across the Product Development Life Cycle

Every product goes through 5 key stages:

1. Brainstorm 🧠
2. Define 🎯
3. Design 🎨
4. Test 🧪
5. Launch 🚀

<Table
  headers={['Stage', 'Research Type', 'Question Answered']}
  rows={[
    ['Brainstorm', '🧱 Foundational Research', '“What should we build?”'],
    ['Design', '🎨 Design Research', '“How should we build it?”'],
    ['Launch', '🚀 Post-Launch Research', '“Did we succeed?”'],
  ]}
/>

🧱 **Foundational Research**

- Aka **strategic** or **generative** research
- Done **before** designing to **empathize** and **inspire ideas.**
- Helps define **user needs + new design directions.**
- May contradict your personal assumptions (and that's good!).
- During this stage, you will also make **personas** and **user stories**.
- 🎯 **Goal**: Figure out **what the user needs** and how to address those needs with your product.
- **Questions to ask:** ❓
  - _What should we build?_
  - _What are the user's problems?_
  - _How can we solve them?_
  - _Am I checking my own biases?_
- **Common foundational research methods include:** 🧰
  - 👤 **Interviews** - A research method that collects in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings.
  - 📋 **Surveys** - Asking many people the same questions to understand product opinions.
  - 👥 **Focus Groups** - Small groups of people whose reactions are studied.
  - 📊 **Competitive Audits** - Study competitors' strengths/weaknesses
  - 🏠 **Field Studies** - Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment.
  - 📔 **Diary Studies** - Collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Users log their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs.

🎨 **Design Research**

- Aka **tactical** research
- Done **while designing** to ensure solutions are usable + user-focused.
- Each design version → new round of research.
- 🎯 **Goal** is to answer the question: How should we **build** it?
- You can conduct design research early with paper sketches 📝, or wait for an interactive prototype 📱. It all depends on your key research goals.
- **Questions to ask:** ❓
  - _How should we build it?_
  - _What works well? What needs improvement?_
  - _How was your experience using this prototype?_
  - _What was easy/difficult?_
  - _Any challenges?_
- **Methods:** 🧰
  - 🧪 **Usability Studies** (the most common method)
    - User research that evaluates the user's experience when interacting with a website or app.
    - **Goal**: Identify user pain points in prototypes. so the issues can be fixed before the product launches.
  - ⚖️ **A/B Testing**
    - Compare two versions (e.g., layout A vs. B)
  - ☕️ **Cafe or Guerrilla Studies**
    - Gathering user feedback by presenting designs or prototypes to the public in informal, real-world settings like cafes or public spaces.
    - Feedback Collection: Asking passersby for their opinions on the presented designs.
    - Example Scenario: Testing an app design in a coffee shop and requesting feedback from customers.
  - 🃏 **Card Sorting**
    - Instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them.
    - Purpose: Determine the information architecture of a project.
  - 📍 **Intercepts**
    - Gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched.
    - Often conducted in the field, providing quick, high-level feedback.
    - Often considered a subset of field research.

🚀 **Post-Launch Research**

- Done **after product launch** to measure success.
- Tied to **real metrics** like usage, satisfaction, adoption.
- 🎯 **Goal** is to answer the question: Did we **succeed**? and evaluate the **real-world impact** of your product
- **Questions to ask:** ❓
  - _Did we succeed?_
  - _Do users like it? Does it meet their needs?_
  - _Was the UX good or poor?_
  - _How does it stack up vs. competitors?_
- **Methods: 🧰**
  - 🧪 **Usability Studies** - Re-evaluate interaction after launch
  - ⚖️ **A/B Testing** - Keep refining features
  - 📋 **Surveys** - Gather user satisfaction data
  - 📈 **Logs Analysis** - A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc.

**Key Takeaway**

- **Great UX = constant research.**
- Always get user feedback **before, during**, and **after** design.
- 🔁 Don't design for the user — **design with the user**.

## UX research methods

🧪 **UX Research Methods = How You Get Answers**

There are two ways we categorize research.

1. **Who conducts the research** 👥
   - **Primary Research** 🧍
     - You collect the data yourself
     - Examples: Interviews, surveys, usability tests
     - Used to dive deeper into specific design problems.
   - **Secondary Research** 📚
     - You use someone else's data
     - Examples: Articles, case studies, existing analytics
     - Done at the very beginning of the product development lifecycle, before any ideation happens.
     - Often done by product leads, not UX designers.
2. **What type of data you're collecting** 📊
   - **Qualitative Research = Why** 🧠
     - **Focus**: Thoughts + behaviors
     - Often based on interviews
     - **Answers Questions Like**: "Why?" "How?"
     - **Data Example**: If you want to know why users are having a bad experience with your product and how to improve it, you should use qualitative research.
   - **Quantitative Research = What** 📈
     - Focus: Numbers + metrics
     - Often based on surveys of large groups of people using numerical answers
     - **Answers Questions Like**: "How many?" "How much?"
     - **Data Example**: If you want to know how the majority of users are experiencing a product, you should use quantitative research.

### Primary Research Methods

🗣️ **Interviews**

- **What it is**: In-depth conversations to explore opinions, thoughts, feelings, experiences.
- **How it works**: 1-on-1 or focus group, mainly open-ended Qs (qual) but can include closed Qs (quant).
- **When to use**:
  - Need detailed, qualitative insights.
  - Understand why users behave a certain way.
- **Example Qs**:
  - ❌ “Rate your experience 1-10.” (quant)
  - ✅ “How was your experience using the app?” (qual, invites storytelling)
- **Best practice**: Run **≥ 5** interviews to spot patterns.
- ✅ **Advantages**:
  - Rich “why” insights.
  - Real-time follow-ups.
  - Customizable for each participant.
  - Direct suggestions from users.
- ❌ **Disadvantages**:
  - Time-consuming & costly.
  - Small sample size.
  - Risk of bandwagon effect in group interviews.
- [User Interviews 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/) by NN Group.

📝 **Surveys**

- **What it is**: Structured questionnaires sent to a large audience.
- **How it works**: Mix of quantitative scales & qualitative free-text. Often remote.

🚀 **Practical Tips**

- **Blend methods**: Use a mix (e.g., interviews → surveys → usability tests) to cover blind spots.
- **Match method to question**:
  - **“Why/how” → qual; “How many/much” → quant**.
- **Track pros & cons** of each method to justify design decisions.
- Use **secondary research** to help decide what's worth spending time and money on in **primary research**.
- **Iterate continuously**: Research → Design → Test → Repeat to improve UX.

📌 **How to Choose a Method**

- The method you choose depends on the **research question**.
- Want to know **what's happening**? → Use **quantitative methods** like surveys.
- Want to know **why it's happening**? → Use **qualitative methods** like interviews.
- Want to improve interaction with a **design or prototype**? → Use **usability studies**.
- **Always start with a clear research goal**, that leads you to the right tool.

## Bias in UX research

📌 **What is Bias?**

- **Bias** = Favoring or having prejudice based on limited info.
- It's often **unconscious** and natural, but can seriously affect your research and design decisions.
- You can't erase bias completely — but you **can be aware** of it and design around it.

🚨 **Why Bias Matters in UX**

- We **aren't the user**, so we need to keep our assumptions in check.
- Bias can lead to **flawed data**, bad design decisions, and products that don't serve real user needs.

### 6 Core Biases in UX Design

1.  🔍 **Confirmation Bias**

    - **What it is**: Seeking out info that supports what you already believe.
    - **Example**: Believing left-handed people are more creative → only noticing studies that confirm that.
    - **Avoid it by**:
      - Asking **open-ended questions**
      - **Actively listening** without inserting your opinion
      - Interviewing a **diverse, large sample** of users

2.  🧍 **False Consensus Bias**

    - **What it is**: Assuming others think like you.
    - **Example**: Thinking all your neighbors share your political beliefs.
    - **Avoid it by**:
      - **Identifying and questioning assumptions**
      - **Surveying a broad and varied user base**
      - Letting users **show you** how they interact with your product (don't lead them)

3.  🕒 **Recency Bias**

    - **What it is**: Overvaluing the **last thing** you heard in a session.
    - **Avoid it by**:
      - Taking **detailed notes** or recordings
      - Reviewing **full sessions**, not just the end

4.  ⏮️ **Primacy Bias**

    - **What it is**: Overvaluing the **first** user or first impression.
    - **Avoid it by**:
      - Using consistent interview structure
      - Taking notes and recordings
      - Avoiding early emotional attachment to ideas

5.  👁️ **Implicit Bias** (a.k.a. Unconscious Bias)

- **What it is**: Unconscious stereotypes or assumptions based on identity (race, gender, age, etc.)
- **Risks**: Limited perspectives, **exclusion**, offensive questions.
- **Avoid it by**:
  - Reflecting on your **own behaviors and assumptions**
  - Asking others to **point out your biases**
  - **Intentionally diversifying** participants

6. 💸 **Sunk Cost Fallacy**

- **What it is**: Sticking with a design just because you already put time into it.
- **Avoid it by**:
  - **Breaking projects into phases**
  - Setting **checkpoints** to reassess
  - Prioritizing **user needs** over effort spent

### Bias in Practice: How to Combat It

🗣️ **Carefully Frame Questions**

- Avoid leading words like “improved.”
- ✅ Instead of: “Do you like the improved layout?”
- ❗ Use: “How do you feel about the button layout?”

💭 **Foster Independent Thinking**

- Group settings = **bandwagon effect**
- Ask participants to write feedback first before group discussion.

📝 **Be Wary of Survey Wording**

- Don't force users into pre-selected answers that reflect your assumptions.
- Offer **“other” options** or open fields for input.

🧭 **Let Users Navigate Freely**

- Don't guide or interrupt.
- Let them **narrate their journey** and discover their natural flow.

👀 **Watch Tone & Body Language**

- If a use's voice or body language seems off, **ask a question to understand better**.
- Warm up with light convo to help them feel comfortable.

😅 **Mind Your Own Signals**

- Your reactions can cause **social desirability bias** (users say what they think you want to hear).
- Stay neutral. Reassure them it's okay to be honest.

⏳ **Plan Recruitment Carefully**

- Avoid **availability bias** (just grabbing whoever's available).
- Recruit people who actually match your user personas.

🧘 **Stay Open-Minded**

- Space interviews out, include teammates, and take notes to avoid **primacy/recency effects**.

🧩 **Final Tips**

- Bias is **universal** but manageable.
- Stay curious, inclusive, and reflective.
- The more aware you are of bias, the better your **research quality** and **design outcomes** will be.
