## Intro to Design Sprints

🚀 **What is a Design Sprint?**

- A design sprint is a **time-bound**, high-focus process that helps teams **solve big design challenges** quickly, usually in **5 phases over 5 days**.
- Think of it as a **shortcut to innovation**:
  - Instead of taking **months**, you **prototype and test** ideas in just **one week**.

📅 **The 5 Phases of a Design Sprint**

1. **Understand**: Get aligned on the challenge, user needs, goals, and business context.
2. **Ideate**: Brainstorm as many creative ideas as possible—no judgment.
3. **Decide**: Choose the most promising solution(s) to move forward with.
4. **Prototype**: Build a quick, realistic version of the idea—just enough to test.
5. **Test**: Get user feedback on the prototype to validate or improve the idea.

🚀 **Why Use a Design Sprint?**

- **Saves Time**
  - Collapses months of meetings into **one focused week.**
- **User-Centered**
  - Keeps **real user needs** at the heart of the process.
- **Reduces Risk**
  - **Test ideas** before making expensive decisions.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**
  - Brings together **designers, engineers, PMs, marketers**, and more.
- **Builds Clarity & Culture**
  - Teams walk away **aligned, energized**, and with clear next steps.

🚀 **When Should You Use a Sprint?**

- **Ask yourself:**
  - Are there **multiple possible solutions** to your design challenge?
  - Do you need input from **cross-functional teams?**
  - Is the challenge **broad enough** to explore over several days?
- If **yes** to any of these, a **design sprint** could be a great fit.

**Key Takeaways**

- Design sprints are **fast, focused** ways to solve big problems
- They include **5 clear phases**
- Ideal when there's **complexity, multiple stakeholders, or unclear direction**
- Helps teams **think big, move fast,** and **stay user-centered**

## 5 phases of design sprints

🏁 **Phase 1: Understand** - Understand user problems

- 💬 **Gather Info:** Team learns about the problem through discussions with experts, data analysis, and user feedback.
- 🤝 **Collaborate** across teams
- 🔍 Focus on **the user** (always!)
- **Key Questions:**
  - What do users need? 🤔
  - What's the goal? 🎯
  - What's getting in the way? 🚧
- 🎯 **Goal:** Everyone gets on the same page. A **clear problem** to solve.

💡 **Phase 2: Ideate / Sketch** - Brainstorm Solutions

- 🧠 Brainstorming + Sketching
- 🎨 No need to be an artist, **ideas over looks**
- 👥 Start **recruiting users** for phase 5 (test!)
- 🎯 **Goal**: Come up with as many **creative solutions** as possible

✅ **Phase 3: Decide** - Choose the Best Solution

- 🔍 Review all ideas and select the best one or combine parts of multiple solutions.
- 📌 Pick the one with the most potential impact by discussing or voting.
- 🗺️ Create a **step-by-step blueprint** for the prototype
- 🎯 **Goal:** Choose the **best solution** to prototype

🛠️ **Phase 4: Prototype** - Build a Quick Prototype

- ⚙️ Doesn't have to be perfect, just **functional** and enough for testing. (e.g., clickable design or model)
- 📲 Focus on **what the user will actually see**
- 🧾 Finalize test schedule + questions
- 🎯 **Goal:** Make something users can try out. A testable prototype.

🧪 **Phase 5: Test (Validate)** - Test with Real Users

- 👀 Prototype is shown to real users for feedback. Observe how they interact.
- 🧠 Gather insights:
  - What worked?
  - What didn't?
  - What was confusing?
  - What needs improvement?
- 🔁 Make **improvements** before launch
- 🎯 **Goal:** Rapid learning from user feedback to refine the solution.

🏁 **Final Recap: Design Sprint Flow**

1. **Understand** → Nail down the problem
2. **Ideate** → Dream up wild + practical solutions
3. **Decide** → Choose the best idea
4. **Prototype** → Build it quick and smart
5. **Test** → Learn from real users

## Design Sprint Planning Basics

**What to do before the sprint begins**

1. **Do That User Research**
   - Start with **the problem** you're solving (even if it's still fuzzy)
   - Focus on **user pain points, needs, and behaviors**
   - Use methods like **interviews, surveys, or user feedback analysis**
   - If there's a UX researcher? Amazing. If not? You got this. 💪
2. **Call In the Experts**
   - Line up **short, info packed talks** from internal or external experts
   - These happen during the **Understand phase**
   - Pro tip: Start scheduling early (people are busy!)
3. **Find the Right Space**
   - Big enough for the whole team to move and brainstorm
   - Must be **inclusive & accessible** for everyone
   - Look for:
     - Whiteboards or writable walls
     - Good acoustics
     - Natural light if possible
     - Movable, comfy furniture
     - A quiet vibe for deep focus
4. **Gather Your Supplies**
   - Think like a teacher prepping class:
     - Markers
     - Sticky notes (like… a lot)
     - Tape, notepads, sketch paper
     - Healthy snacks & water (brain fuel)
     - Timer for keeping sessions snappy
5. **Establish Ground Rules**
   - Set the tone: creative, focused, distraction-free
   - Example rules:
     - No phones/laptops unless needed
     - Respect time limits
     - Listen actively
     - Everyone contributes
   - You're creating a **safe space for wild ideas**
6. **Plan Introductions + Icebreakers**
   - Sprints = cross-functional teams who might not know each other
   - Icebreaker tip: Share a time you had to call customer service, how did it go? (Puts folks in the user's shoes right away)
7. **Plan for What's Next (Post-Sprint)**
   - Document everything:
     - Take photos of boards/sticky notes
     - Assign someone to jot down key insights
     - Record big decisions
   - Think about:
     - How will results be shared?
     - Who owns follow-up actions?
     - What's the timeline for the next steps?

## Sprint Retrospective: Reflect, Refine, Repeat

**What Is It?**

A retrospective is a chill, team-wide debrief right after the sprint ends. It's a safe space to reflect on:
No pressure, no shame, just a chance to learn and level up for next time.

**How Does It Work?**

- Everyone who participated in the sprint joins in
- The sprint leader facilitates the discussion
- Someone takes notes so feedback can be turned into action
- No rigid agenda, just open, honest conversation

**Why Is It Important?**

- Retrospectives help teams:
  - Work more efficiently together 🤝
  - Improve communication 🗣️
  - Identify gaps in tools, resources, or workflows 🧰
  - Encourage personal growth and team accountability 🙌

**Pro Tips for a Great Retrospective:**

- Keep the vibe **supportive**, not judgmental
- Make sure everyone gets a chance to speak
- Turn feedback into **action items** for next time
- Celebrate the wins! 🎉 (Big and small)

**Design Sprint Retrospective: Common Questions & Key Ideas**

A design sprint retrospective is a team feedback session held right after the sprint. It's not about the design itself, it's about the process.

✅ **What Went Well?**

- This is the feel good section! Focus on what worked.
- 💬 Questions a UX designer might ask during this part of the retrospective include:
  - Which tools saved me the most time and effort?
  - When did I feel most satisfied?
  - What helped me make my best contribution to the team during this sprint?
  - Tip: Recognize strong team performance here, it boosts morale and team spirit!

🔧 **What Can Be Improved?**

- Shift gears to reflect on any roadblocks or missed opportunities.
- 💬 Questions a UX designer might ask during this part of the retrospective include:
  - What went wrong that caught me off guard?
  - Which problems came up repeatedly?
  - When did we face our biggest team challenge?
  - Then, a designer examines the sprint's outcome or final product, and ask questions like:
    - Did we over/underestimate the work?
    - Did any external factors derail us?
    - Most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?
- **Avoid groupthink:** Groupthink happens when a group discussion starts with one person sharing an opinion, and everyone agrees without sharing their own thoughts. Encourage anonymous feedback if needed. Let everyone have a voice.

💡 **Lessons Learned**

- Think ahead. What will you or the team do differently next time?
- 💬 Questions a UX designer might ask include:
  - What did I discover during the sprint that I'm still wondering about?
  - How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?

**Key Takeaways**

- Retrospectives are about **empowerment**, not blame.
- Focus on **process improvement**, not personal performance.
- Collaboration and honesty = better outcomes for everyone.
- The **only bad suggestion is the one not shared!**
