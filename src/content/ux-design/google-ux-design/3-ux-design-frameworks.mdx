## The UX Design Frameworks

- **Framework**: Creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve
- Framework depends on company, team or project you work on, you won't use the dame framework every time

**Common Frameworks are**:

- **User-Centered design**
- **Five elements of UX Design**
- **Design thinking**
- **Lean UX**
- **Double Diamond model**

## User-Centered Design

**What is User-Centered Design (UCD)?**

- UCD means trying to **solve problems that people commonly experience** rather than trying to solve only those problems that you experience personally.
- Why? Because the **user is the one using and buying** your product!
- "Focus on the user and all else will follow." - Google UX motto

**Avoid Designer Bias**

- Designing for yourself can be risky
- UCD reduces bias by focusing on real people
- Watch, listen, and learn from users — Larry Page (Google co-founder) emphasized this too

**The 4-Step UCD Process**

1. 🔍 **Understand**
   - Learn how **users currently interact** with your product (or similar ones)
   - Requires **research**: interviews, observations, surveys, etc.
2. 🎯 **Specify**
   - Pinpoint the most important **user needs** based on your research
   - Define the **core problem** to solve
3. 🧱 **Design**
   - Create and build **solutions** for the user's problem
   - Start with **ideas**, then move into **prototypes** and early versions of the product
4. 🧪 **Evaluate**
   - Test with **real users**
   - Ask: _Does this design solve their problem?_
   - Collect feedback and identify gaps

🔁 **Iteration = Essential**

- **Iterate** = Repeat and refine based on feedback
- Each version improves on the last — UCD is a **cyclical** process, not one-and-done!

**Real Example: Google Photos**

- Originally: Just a place to **store photos**
- Through user feedback: Discovered users wanted to **relive memories**
- Result: Redesigned to support **search**, **memories**, and **moments** — classic UCD in action!

**Key Takeaway**

- UCD is all about **designing with users in mind**, every step of the way
- It results in products that are **more useful**, **intuitive**, and **loved**
- Use UCD when **usability** and **user experience** are your top priorities

## Five Elements of UX Design

A framework that breaks down how an idea becomes a functional, user-centered product—layer by layer, from abstract to concrete.

**Overview**

- **Each element builds on the one below it**
- Helps designers move from **strategy** to **visuals** in a logical, - step-by-step process
- 🛠️ Created by **Jesse James Garrett**

1. **Strategy (The Why)**
   - Define the **user's needs**
   - Identify **business objectives**
   - This is the foundation for every decision afterward
   - Ask: _Why are we building this? Who is it for?_
2. **Scope (The What)**
   - Decide **what features** and **content** to include
   - Turn strategy into **specific requirements**
   - Clarifies what you're actually **building**
3. **Structure (The How It Works)**
   - Determine the **organization** of information
   - Define **user interactions** and navigation paths
   - Sets up the **user flow** and functionality logic
4. **Skeleton (The Blueprint)**
   - Think: **layout + interface architecture**
   - Design **placement** of buttons, menus, images, etc.
   - User doesn't see this layer directly—like **bones under the skin**
   - Helps ensure a smooth and usable experience
5. **Surface (The Visuals)**
   - What the user actually **sees on screen**
   - Focuses on **look and feel**: colors, typography, icons, and visual polish
   - It's the **skin** of the product

**Key Takeaway**

- From **strategy to surface**, each layer helps shape a meaningful, effective, and user-friendly product.
- Use this framework to **stay focused**, **aligned**, and **intentional** at every stage of design.

## Design Thinking

**What is Design Thinking?**

- **Design Thinking** is a **user-centered** approach for solving problems and building effective solutions.
- It provides **structure**, encourages **collaboration**, and helps spark **innovation**.
- Commonly used by UX designers from **initial idea** to **final product launch**.
- In this framework, you'll go through **5 key phases**—but it's **not linear**, it's **iterative**.

**The 5 Phases of Design Thinking**

![Process flow that represents the design thinking process: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test.](/google-ux-design-assets/design-thinking-phases.png)

1. **Empathize** 👥
   - **Goal**: Understand the **user**, their **problems**, **wants**, **needs**, and **context**.
   - **Methods**:
     - User surveys
     - Interviews
     - Observation sessions
     - Competitor research
   - Key idea: **Drop assumptions** and let **research findings** guide your design.
2. **Define** 🎯
   - **Goal**: Analyze research to define **which user problems to solve** and **why**.
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Clear **problem statement**
     - Optional: **Value proposition**
   - Key idea: Pinpoint the **real user need** to give the design a focused goal.
3. **Ideate** 💡
   - **Goal**: Generate **as many solutions** as possible — quantity over quality (at first!).
   - **Activities**:
     - **Brainstorming** with cross-functional teams
     - **Exploration without judgment**
     - Use research to narrow ideas
     - Create **user flows**
   - Key idea: **Don't settle on the first idea** — the best one might be hidden.
4. **Prototype** ✏️
   - **Goal**: Build **early models** that represent design ideas.
   - **Start simple**:
     - Sketches
     - Wireframes
     - Sitemaps
   - Move to **low-fidelity prototypes**, then **high-fidelity interactive models**.
   - Prototyping is **iterative** and **interconnected** with testing.
5. **Test** 🧪
   - **Goal**: Get **user feedback** to refine your design and validate usability.
   - **Strategies**:
     - Test early and often
     - Use different **fidelity levels**
     - Compare **multiple prototypes**
   - Key idea: Keep refining based on what **users actually need and do**, not just opinions.

🧩 **Big Picture: Design Thinking Principles**

- 👤 **User-first mindset**
- 🛠️ **Solve real problems**
- 🤝 **Cross-team collaboration**
- ✅ **Validate designs through feedback**
- 🔁 **Iterate continuously**

**In Practice**: The framework you use might vary depending on the **organization** or **product**.

## UX Design Business Requirements

**Where Design Thinking Really Starts**

- While the **Design Thinking framework** begins with **Empathize**, real-world projects often start with a **design assignment**.
- That assignment comes with **business requirements** that UX designers must understand **before diving into the process**.
- These requirements shape every phase of the design thinking process.

**What Are Business Requirements?** 📊

- Business requirements = **project constraints + strategic direction**
- They usually include two main types:
  - **Business goals typically describe:**
    - The users they want the design to target
    - The outcomes they want the design to achieve
    - Their vision for the design's final look and functionality
  - **Business goals typically describe:**
    - The project's budget, timeline, and scope
    - The specific tools and systems that designers must use or design for
    - The requirements and standards the design must meet

**Business Requirements in Action**

- Business requirements are **not set in stone** they may **evolve** throughout the project.
- They influence how designers empathize, prototype, and test, because every phase takes time, money, and resources.
- **Example**:
  - A freelance UX designer is hired by a local bakery to create a website.
  - The bakery's business requirements:
    - Simple site with online ordering (no third-party services)
    - Easy navigation, maintenance, and updates
    - Must reflect the brand and appeal to a 35-70 local demographic
    - Must stay within a modest budget and short timeframe
  - The designer uses these requirements to:
    - Understand user needs
    - Plan design activities
    - Stay within constraints while still delivering value

**Key Takeaways**

- **Real UX work begins** by reviewing the **business assignment** and its **requirements**
- Business requirements = **Goals + Parameters**
- Great UX = Balancing **user needs** and **business needs**
- Designers revisit business requirements **throughout** the Design Thinking process to stay aligned
- Every phase of the process must fit within **budget, tools**, and **timeline**

## The 5 Phases of Design Thinking: In Detail

### Phase 1: Empathize with Users

🎯 **Goal**: To **deeply** and **without bias** understand users regarding their:

- Feelings
- Thoughts
- Needs
- Environments

Empathy helps designers create products that feel **human**, solve **real problems**, and build **long-term engagement**.

🧱 **Build on Business Requirements**

- Business requirements often give some user info, but it's usually **limited** or **assumption-based**
- Use the **empathize phase** to **validate, update, and expand** on this info
- Always consider **budget, timeline**, and **available resources**

🔍 **Empathy Research Methods**

💬 **Interviews**

- Interviews take many forms, but UX designers most commonly use four:
  - 📝 Questionnaires/Surveys
  - 👥 In-person Interviews
  - 📞 Phone Interviews
  - 📹 Video Interviews
- Balance the **depth of insights** with project **constraints** (time, money, scope)

🗺️ **Empathy Maps**

- Once designers have conducted their interviews, they can turn to empathy maps.
- **Helps process interview data by answering:**
  - Who exactly **are** the users and what are their situations?
  - What do users **say** about their experiences with the product or similar products?
  - What do users **think** about their experiences?
  - What do users **do** before, during, and after their experiences?
  - What do users **feel** about their experiences?
- **Example**:
  - Business says older users dislike online forms.
  - Empathy research shows they actually find phone ordering **faster** and more **personable**, not that they're uncomfortable with tech.

👤 **User Personas**

- Personas are **fictional characters who represent groups of similar users**.
- They help designers distill large amounts of user information into more manageable chunks.
- **Example**:
  - The older bakery customers prefer ordering over the phone for a mix of reasons. But rather than try to remember these details in the abstract, the designer creates a user persona who brings this customer to life:
  - Berta is an older customer who has built connections with bakery staff over time and enjoys connecting with them while ordering over the phone.
  - Also, she has a visual impairment and finds phone ordering faster and more convenient than ordering online.
- **Personas help designers:**
  - Keep users in mind throughout design thinking (avoids remembering every detail).
  - Explain design choices to stakeholders through compelling, contextual stories.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Empathize** = truly understanding users through **research and connection**
- Use methods like **interviews, empathy maps**, and **personas**
- Design within **business constraints** (budget, tools, timeline)
- Always seek to **go beyond assumptions** and uncover the real “why” behind user behavior

### Phase 2: Define Users Needs

🎯 **Goal**: Take everything learned in the **empathize phase and pinpoint the core user problems** your design will solve.

- This phase helps you move from **understanding users to prioritizing** their needs.
- **Ask yourself:**
  - **What are the most important user problems or needs my design should address?**

🧰 **Tools for the Define Phase**

🧾 **User Stories**

- While a user persona distills a large group of similar users into a single character, user stories help designers focus their understanding of those users even more.
- One-sentence snapshots from a **users point of view**, using this format:
  - It should encapsulate **who** the user is, **what** they want to do, and **why** they want to do it. The following is a simple template for writing a user story:
  - **As [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].**
  - **Helps:**
    - Focus on **user motivation**
    - Guide the **design direction**
    - Create a **checklist** of user goals
- **Example** (Berta one of the user personas in the bakery example):
  - **As a** long-time customer with a visual impairment and a close connection to the bakery staff, **I want to** place my orders over the phone **so I can** order with ease and continue to connect with staff members.

🧭 **User Journeys**

- Once a designer has distilled their user groups into realistic personas and stories, it's time to start mapping out each persona's user journey.
- A step-by-step **map of the user's experience** trying to reach a goal.
  - Includes:
  - What users **do**
  - What they **think** and **feel**
  - Where they encounter **pain points**
- **Helps identify:**
  - Gaps and friction
  - Opportunities for better experiences
- **Example:**
  - Create **two journeys** for each persona:
    1. How Berta currently orders (phone & social media)
    2. How Berta might order via a future website

🚧 **Problem Statements**

- With complete user journeys for each persona, a designer can better identify the problems their design must solve or the needs their design must address. Then, they can distill these problems or needs into problem statements.
- A problem statement summarizes **who** the user is, **what** they need from a design, and **why**. The following is a simple template for writing a problem statement:
- **[Name of user persona]** is a **[type of user]** who needs **[type of user experience]** because **[benefits of user experience]**.
- This template is similar to a user story, but problem statements are typically more detailed, and they are written from the designer's perspective.
- Effective UX designers create problem statements for each of their user personas.
- **Helps:**
  - Keep the focus on **real problems**
  - Design for **multiple user types**, not just one
- **Example** (Berta):
  - Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she's making a personal connection with the bakery.

**Key Takeaways**

- The **Define phase** is about turning empathy research into clear, actionable **user needs**
- Use tools like **user stories, user journeys**, and **problem statements** to clarify:
  - What users need
  - Why they need it
  - How the design can help
- Keep **business requirements** and **constraints** in mind to guide feasible solutions

### Phase 3: Ideate Solutions

🎯 **Goal**: Generate a wide range of **creative solutions** to address the **user problems** defined in Phase 2.

- This is the **big brainstorm** moment of design thinking!
- **Ask yourself:**
  - **How might we solve our users biggest problems in a way that's creative, user-friendly, and realistic?**

🧱 **Ideation Basics**

- **Suspend judgment** — All ideas are welcome at first, even wild ones.
- **Quantity > quality** early on — more ideas = better chances of finding a great one.
- **Collaborate** with teammates, stakeholders, and users.
- **Circle back** to business requirements to make sure ideas are feasible.

💡 **Popular Ideation Techniques**

❓ **“How Might We?” (HMW)**

- Take your **problem statements** from the define phase and turn them into **questions** starting with:
- **How might we...**
- **Helps:**
  - Reframe problems into **opportunities**
  - Kickstart brainstorming sessions
- **Example** (for Berta):
  - **Problem statement: **Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she's
  - If the bakery's UX designer reframed this problem statement as a series of HMW questions, they might include:
    - **How might we** make the online ordering process easy to use?
    - **How might we** mimic a friendly phone conversation online?
    - **How might we** adapt to Berta's vision needs digitally?
- After creating these HMW questions, good UX designers spend time answering them with as many possible solutions as they can think of and they don't hold back!

✏️ **Rapid Sketching (aka Crazy Eights)**

- While “How might we?” focuses on written questions and solutions, **Rapid Sketching is a visual approach to ideation**.
- Visual brainstorming on paper. Great for **UI ideas, flows, **or **layouts**.
- **Steps:**
  - Fold paper into **8 squares**
  - Set a timer for **8 minutes**
  - Sketch **1 idea per square**, 1 min each
  - **Goal:** Fast, visual thinking — no overthinking!

🔍 **Competitive Audits**

- Study what competitors are doing to solve similar problems.
- **Ask:**
  - What **products** are they offering?
  - What works? What doesn't?
  - Where are the **gaps or opportunities?**
- **Goal:** Learn from others, **get inspired**, and **avoid known pitfalls**.

🧩 **SCAMPER Method**

- A checklist to tweak and reimagine ideas.
- Each letter prompts a new type of thinking:
  - Substitute
  - Combine
  - Adapt
  - Modify
  - Put to another use
  - Eliminate
  - Rearrange
- **Goal:** Break existing ideas into new ones with a creative remix.

🤝 **Collaborate Effectively**

- Before a team brainstorm:
  - **Define:**
    - **Who** is involved?
    - **Where** is the session (virtual or in-person)?
    - **Why** are you collaborating (the goal)?
    - **How** will you work together (tools/processes)?
- Collaboration brings in **diverse perspectives** and **fresh energy**.

💼 **Tie Back to Business Requirements**

- Once you've got lots of ideas, **filter them** through:
  - ⏰ Time constraints
  - 💰 Budget limits
  - 🧭 Product vision
  - 📈 Feasibility
- Goal: Keep the **creative spark**, but stay grounded in **what's possible** and **valuable**.

**Key Takeaways**

- Ideation is about **creative problem-solving** and **brainstorming** freely.
- Use tools like:
  - **HMW questions**
  - **Rapid Sketching**
  - **Competitive Audits**
  - **SCAMPER**
- Collaborate with others and **embrace wild ideas**, then narrow them down based on **real world constraints**.

### Phase 4: Prototype Solutions

🎯 **Goal**: Create **early models** of the product that users and stakeholders can **see, interact with, and give feedback on**, before development begins.

- Think of it as: **Let's build a version we can test, not perfect**.

**What's Prototyping All About?**

- NOT the final product.
- It's about **exploring**, **experimenting**, and **learning**.
- Helps evaluate design decisions **before** they get expensive.

🗺️ **Information Architecture (IA) + Sitemaps**

- **IA = How information is structured + navigated**
  - **Hierarchy** → What's most important? What's grouped together?
  - **Sequence** → What's the user's path or flow?
- **Sitemaps**
  - **A visual map** of all the pages/screens in a product.
  - **Helps users:**
    - Understand where they are
    - Navigate easily
  - **Helps designers:**
    - Plan layout and content
    - Reflect user needs (like Berta's preference for a “friendly phone-order feel”)

✏️ **Wireframing: Early Page Sketches**

- Wireframes are **basic blueprints** of a product's layout and flow.
- Wireframes are rough sketches of the product that bring the sitemap to life.

📝 **Paper Wireframes**

- Quick sketches using shapes and lines
- Great for brainstorming multiple ideas fast
- Super low cost

💻 **Digital Wireframes**

- Made with tools like Figma, Adobe XD
- Use grayscale, placeholders, and basic UI
- Great for team collaboration and quick edits

🧪 **Prototypes: Turning Sketches into Simulations**

- In UX, “fidelity” means how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product

🔹 **Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Prototypes**

- Simple, clickable models
- Connect wireframes to show flow
- Focus on **structure**, **navigation**, and **basic layout**
- Great for early user testing and fast feedback

🔸 **High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Prototypes**

- Look and act like the real product
- Include color, visuals, content, real interactivity
- Closer to what users will actually experience
- **Use for:**
  - Presenting to stakeholders
  - Detailed feedback on usability, visuals, and tone

🔄 **Prototype + Test = Design BFFs**

- Prototyping and testing go hand-in-hand.
- **Build it → test it → improve it → repeat!**
- Always loop back to earlier stages:
  - Does it solve the **defined problem?**
  - Does it reflect what users **actually need?**
- **Example**: For Berta (the bakery customer), test whether the prototype:
  - Feels **warm and personal**
  - Is **easy to navigate**
  - Accommodates her **vision needs**

**Key Takeaways**

- Prototyping = making **testable versions** of your ideas.
- Techniques include:
  - 🗺️ **Information Architecture**
  - 📊 **Sitemaps**
  - ✏️ **Wireframes** (paper + digital)
  - 🔹 **Lo-Fi Prototypes**
  - 🔸 **Hi-Fi Prototypes**
- The goal is **learning, improving,** and **prepping for testing**.
- This phase is **iterative**, go back, tweak, refine!

### Phase 5: Test Solutions

🎯 **Goal**: **Test your prototype** with real or representative users to see if it **actually solves the problem** and **refine** it based on what you learn.

- Think of testing as **proof + polish**: Does it work? Can it be better?

🔁 **Testing = Iteration**

- Prototyping and testing go hand-in-hand.
- Build it → test it → improve it → repeat!
- Always loop back to earlier stages:
- **Example:**
  - In the bakery project, the UX designer tested **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** prototypes with users like Berta, improving the design each time based on feedback.

🕵️‍♀️ **UX Testing Plan**

👥 **Who will participate in the tests?**

- Early stage: Friends, teammates, informal testers
- Later stage: Real users **matching personas**

📋 **What types of tests will be conducted?**

- Different types (e.g. usability testing, A/B testing) gather **different insights**

🏠 **When and where will the tests be conducted?**

- In-person or remote
- Choose based on time, budget, access, and business requirements

🧪 **Why are the tests conducted?**

- UX tests aim to understand users and improve their experiences. During design thinking, some of the most common reasons for testing are to:
  - ✅ **Validate ideas, information, or decisions** from other phases, such as user information generated during empathize or design decisions made during ideation.
  - 🚧 **Uncover usability issues** (user pain points) that can be addressed through further iteration and prototyping. These issues are pain points that prevent users from using the product effectively.

🧍‍♀️ **How will participants engage with the prototype?**

- Is the **test accessible and inclusive?**
- Consider assistive tech, clear instructions, and ease of interaction

📝 **How will feedback be collected?**

- Direct: interviews, surveys, observations
- Indirect: behavior analytics, system logs
- Use methods that best fit your goals and users

💡 **Real-World Example: Bakery Website**

- User tested: Berta
- Low-fidelity prototype tested → revealed some issues
- High-fidelity prototype tested → improved based on feedback
- Final design was accessible, enjoyable, and met business goals

**Key Takeaways**

- Testing helps designers **refine prototypes** and ensure the design **actually works** for users
- Effective testing requires:
  - Careful **planning**
  - The right **participants**
  - An inclusive, accessible process
- Insights from testing guide the final design before it's **handed off to developers**
